Explainer for UML and flow charts (external)
http://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvgestwicki/misc/uml/

DUE: FRIDAY MORNING 11-6-20
Project overview - Create UML diagrams for list of products.
Exercise knowledge of Java in implementing base ID, states, and behaviors in a manner consistent with UML diag standards

UML would represent chosen identities states and behaviors.
Example:

//establish a class with ID
public class ExampleProductWake {

  //establish variables and encapsulate the state
  private int batteryLevel;
  public String greeting;

  //Use a constructor for runtime state update
  public ExampleProductWake) {
    public String greeting = "Hello!";
    private int battery = 100;
    wakeUpString = String.format(greeting + "I have %d battery, and I'm ready to go", battery);
    return wakeUpString;
  }

  //establish methods to use when states need to be altered, or actions taken on the object
  // Good opportunity to try and use polymorphism.
  // Example - Have two methods named "setBattery" using one to accept direct assignment from input integer,
     // value representing "decrement" or "increment" which dings or adds one point to battery
     // and one to accept a string
  private static Integer setBattery(int battery) {
    battery = newValue;
    return battery
  }

  public String setGreeting(string greeting) {
    newGreeting = greeting;
    return newGreeting;
  }

}
